## 🔐 AI Models for Cybersecurity Threat Prediction – Solid Facts

### 1. **Supervised ML**
- **Random Forest** → High accuracy, robust with noisy data, low false positives.  
  *Limitation:* Slow for real-time scale.  
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost)** → State-of-the-art classification, fast inference, handles imbalance.  
  *Limitation:* Needs tuning, noise-sensitive.  
- **SVM** → Accurate for small datasets, binary classification.  
  *Limitation:* Not scalable, slow training.

### 2. **Deep Learning**
- **CNNs** → Malware as images, strong feature extraction, high accuracy.  
  *Limitation:* Needs GPU + large datasets.  
- **RNNs/LSTMs** → Sequence/log analysis, user behavior analytics.  
  *Limitation:* Slow training, adversarial vulnerability.  
- **Autoencoders** → Learn normal behavior, detect anomalies, zero-day detection.  
  *Limitation:* Hard to tune, noise-sensitive.  
- **GNNs** → Model IOC relationships, detect multi-step attacks.  
  *Limitation:* Requires graph engineering.

### 3. **NLP Models**
- **Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT)** → Text-based threat analysis, phishing detection, multilingual.  
  *Limitation:* Heavy compute load.  
- **Domain-Adapted LLMs** → Automate SOC tasks, generate rules, summarize incidents.  
  *Limitation:* Risk of hallucinations.
